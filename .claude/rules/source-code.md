You are modifying source code or tests. This rule applies everywhere
except CLASI's own process artifacts and docs — `.clasi/`, `.claude/`,
`docs/`, and `*.md` files are not source code and are not gated by this
rule (no glob can express "everything except these four," so this
exclusion lives here in prose instead of in `paths:`).

Before writing code:

1. If `.clasi/oop` exists, the stakeholder has opted out of CLASI
   for this session. Skip these gates entirely and proceed.
2. You must have a ticket in `in-progress` status, or the stakeholder
   said "out of process".
3. If you have a ticket, follow the execute-ticket skill — call
   `get_skill_definition("execute-ticket")` if unsure of the steps.
4. Run the project's test suite after changes.
5. A commit message is not a process action. Only an MCP call (e.g.
   `update_ticket_status`, `move_ticket_to_done`) moves a ticket —
   writing "closes 005" or similar in a commit message does not.
